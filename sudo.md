### Implementation

Please design and implement a product for users to run investor meetings in. Your product should meet the following product requirements, at a minimum:

- An agenda

  - A list of meeting topics
    - Each topic contains a title, time estimate, and a text description
  - Users should be able to navigate between topics
  - The presenter should be able to add, delete and edit topics

  ### Extra credit

If you've finished the product requirements above, the following would also be cool (though not necessary):

- Your design is easy to use
- Users can communicate with each other in some way (chat, audio, etc.)
- Some way to keep track of whether the meeting is running on time
- Topics have content beyond normal text (like rich text, links, images, attachments)
- Users can see who is looking at which topics
- Other features not listed here that you think would be useful for the user

# Demo

Please record a short 5 minute video of your solution.

- Demonstrate the product and how it is used
- Explain your code at a high level. (Architecture decisions, stack, design, ...)
- You may also discuss any problems you ran into and how you dealt with them

# Submission

Please send an email to team@surfboard.team with the following:

- Link to your code (such as a git repository or repl.it)
- Link to your video
